# Panoramascope

Panoramascope is a computer vision-based system that generates a panoramic image from a video. This tool processes video input, stitches frames, and produces a seamless panoramic view using advanced image processing techniques.

## Features
- Converts video into panoramic images
- Easy-to-use with minimal setup
- Leverages computer vision algorithms for accurate stitching

## Requirements
To get started, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Necessary dependencies (provided in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Panoramascope.git
   cd Panoramascope
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the `Panoramascope` script and add your video path:
   ```python
   video_path = "path/to/your/video.mp4" 
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Panoramascope.py
   ```

3. The resulting panorama image will be saved in the output directory.

## Example
Provide an example to demonstrate the system's output:
- Input: A video of a rotating camera capturing a 360-degree view
- Output: A seamless panoramic image

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue to improve the system.
